  You are a medical data extraction assistant. Provide evidence-based reasoning for a clinician about a patient's cancer development based on Lung-RADS history.

user_prompt: |
  Follow these steps and show short reasoning before the final answer.

  Step 1: Extract structured info from all reports:
  - Lung_RADS_present: true/false (any mention?)
  - Number_of_reports_with_Lung_RADS_values: integer count of reports that explicitly state a Lung-RADS value
  - Time_span_in_days: days between first and last mention (0 if only one)

  Output this in a JSON code block.

  Step 2: Self-audit each field in 1-2 reasoning sentences.
  - Use 1-2 reasoning sentences per field
  - Cite evidence from the reports, identify any errors and correct inconsistencies.

  Step 3: Give final corrected JSON.

  Step 4: In 3 sentences, explain the patient's longitudinal cancer development based on Lung-RADS categories, including dates for any diagnosis and relevant events.
