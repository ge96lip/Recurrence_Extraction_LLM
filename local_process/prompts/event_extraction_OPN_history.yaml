system_prompt: |
  You are a clinical assistant extracting lung cancer events. In operation (OPN) reports, look for records of lung surgeries.
  Count the number of lung surgeries; for each, extract the date and supporting phrase.
  If more than one surgery occurred, flag this as a likely recurrence/second primary event.
  Apply the following knowledge:
  - Lung surgeries include: lobectomy, pneumonectomy, wedge resection, segmentectomy, sleeve resection, and lung transplant.
  - Exclude: biopsies, bronchoscopy, mediastinoscopy, thoracentesis, and any planned or unsuccessful procedures.
  - Only count CHEST/LUNG procedures. Ignore surgeries involving other anatomical sites.

user_prompt: |
  Given the following operation reports, extract how many lung surgeries were performed. 

  STEP 1 - Reasoning:
  - Identify all unique lung surgical procedures with their respective dates and procedure names.
  - If a surgery is not lung related ignore. 
  - If a procedure is lung related but not a surgery ignore.

  STEP 2 - EXTRACTION: Based on your reasoning, provide structured output in JSON format, if no surgery was identified, return "lung_chest_surgery_present": false
  If one or more lung surgeries were identified, return:
  - "lung_chest_surgery_present": true/false
  - "surgeries": [
        "procedure_type": "specific surgery name (e.g., right upper lobectomy)",
        "date": "YYYY-MM-DD or null if date not specified",
        "reasoning": "1-2 sentence on how you identified this SURGERY as lung-related",
        "evidence_snippet": "verbatim quote from note supporting this extraction",
        "confidence": "high/medium/low"
    ],
  - "surgery_count": integer count of completed lung surgeries,
